    "Imagine a library:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalar**: A single book.\n",
    "- **Vector**: A shelf with a row of books.\n",
    "- **Matrix**: A bookshelf with rows (shelves) and columns (positions on each shelf).\n",
    "- **Tensor**: A whole library building with multiple floors, each containing several bookshelves. Each book’s location can be identified by specifying the floor, shelf, and position on the shelf. This layered structure is similar to how tensors work in multiple dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "Tensors are kind of like rigid and strictly defined multidimensional hashes, at least as far as indexing goes. This is a very naive comparison, but one very useful for my understanding. For example, a perl hash can read like $HASH->{floor}->{shelf}->{position}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors are a type of multidimensional array that abides by mathematical rules to ensure they capture intrinsic geometric or physical relationships no matter the coordinate system viewed in."
