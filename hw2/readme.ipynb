    "# Homework 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will train **deep networks** to classify images from *SuperTuxKart*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./viz.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework will require a GPU - if you don't have access to one, you can use Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided some additional instructions in this [starter colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k-OTy-eM7BDHqOrRyM9yTeLFvqdjpzvd)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup + Starter Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The starter code contains a `data` directory where you'll copy (or symlink) the [SuperTuxKart Classification Dataset](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bzhou/dl_class/classification_data.zip).\n",
    "Unzip the data directly into the homework folder, replacing the existing data directory completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you see the following directories and files inside your main directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "homework/\n",
    "grader/\n",
    "bundle.py\n",
    "classification_data/train\n",
    "classification_data/val\n",
    "```\n",
    "You will run all scripts from inside this main directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `homework` directory, you'll find the following starter code files\n",
    "- `train.py` - code to train, evaluate and save your models\n",
    "- `models.py` - where you will implement various models\n",
    "- `logger.py` - utility functions to log your model's performance using Tensorboard\n",
    "- `utils.py` - data loader for the SuperTuxKart dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Loader\n",
    "\n",
    "In `utils.py` we have provided a data loader for the SuperTuxKart dataset.\n",
    "Labels and the corresponding image paths are saved in `labels.csv` and there are 6 classes of objects.\n",
    "In our setting, the label `background` corresponds to 0, `kart` is 1, `pickup` is 2, `nitro` is 3, `bomb` is 4 and `projectile` 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the `SuperTuxDataset` class and the `__init__`, `__len__`, and the `__getitem__` functions, as this demonstrates how to load and preprocess data for classification tasks.\n",
    "- `__init__` reads the csv file and stores the image paths and labels.\n",
    "- `__len__` returns the size of the dataset.\n",
    "- `__getitem__` returns a tuple of image, label where image is a `torch.Tensor` of size `(3,64,64)` with range `[0,1]`, and the label is an `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you have access to two different directories of data:\n",
    "- a training set (used to train the model)\n",
    "- a validation set (used to approximate your performance on new unseen data).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we grade your solution, we will use a third data split (a hidden test set).\n",
    "We split the data into three to help you prevent overfitting (a phenomenon where the network performs very well on its training data, but cannot make sense of any new data; more on this later in class).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Grader Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can grade your implementation after any part of the homework by running the following command from the main directory:\n",
    "- `python3 -m grader homework -v` for medium verbosity\n",
    "- `python3 -m grader homework -vv` to include print statements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logging (10 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is an important part of training models and provides a way to monitor/track your experiments.\n",
    "We start by learning how to use `tensorboard`, a tool for monitoring the training of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a dummy training procedure in `logger.py` and provided you an instance of a `tb.SummaryWriter`.\n",
    "Implement the rest of `test_logging`.\n",
    "Use the summary writer to log the training loss at every iteration, the training accuracy at each epoch and the validation accuracy at each epoch.\n",
    "Remember to log everything in *global training steps*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple example of how to use the `SummaryWriter`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch.utils.tensorboard as tb\n",
    "\n",
    "logger = tb.SummaryWriter('cnn')\n",
    "logger.add_scalar('train/loss', t_loss, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In `logger.py`, you should **not** create your own `SummaryWriter`, but rather use the one provided.\n",
    "You can test your logger by calling\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m homework.logger --exp_dir logs\n",
    "```\n",
    "To view the logs in tensorboard,\n",
    "- Spawn a new terminal and start a tensorboard server: `tensorboard --logdir logs`.\n",
    "- Open up a web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually `localhost:6006`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification Loss (10 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll implement the `ClassificationLoss` in `models.py`.\n",
    "We will later use this loss to train our classifiers.\n",
    "You should implement the log-likelihood of a softmax classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-\\log\\left(\\frac{\\exp(x_l) }{ \\sum_j \\exp(x_j)} \\right),$$\n",
    "where $x$ are the logits and $l$ is the label.\n",
    "You may use existing PyTorch functions to implement this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant Operations\n",

    "Implement the `LinearClassifier` class in `models.py`.\n",
    "Define the linear model and all layers in the `__init__` function, then implement `forward`.\n",
    "Your `forward` function receives a `(B,3,64,64)` tensor as an input and should return a `(B,6)` `torch.Tensor` (one value per class), where `B` stands for batch size.\n",
    "You can earn these full credits without training the model, just from the correct model definition.\n",
