    "Unlike before, the arrows mean something slightly different. In the first graph, the represented inputs to functions. They now mean that the gradient is multiplied by the next gradient. Due to the sizes of the matrices and the operations required, we start from the back and work our way back toward the parameters when calculating gradient - this is **backpropogation**. This style also allows us to calculate the gradient of all parameters in a single pass.\n",
